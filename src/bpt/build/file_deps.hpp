/**
 * The `file_deps` module implements the interdependencies of inputs files to their outputs, as well
 * as the command that was used to generate that output from the inputs.
 *
 * For a given output, there is exactly one command that was used to generate it, and some non-zero
 * number of input relations. A single input relation encapsulates the path to that input as well as
 * the file modification time at which that input was used. The modification times are specifically
 * stored on the input relation, and not associated with the input file itself, as more than one
 * output may make use of a single input, and each output will need to keep track of the
 * outdated-ness of its inputs separately.
 *
 * A toolchain has an associated `file_deps_mode`, which can be deduced from the compiler_id. The
 * three dependency modes are:
 *
 * 1. None - No dependency tracking takes place.
 * 2. GNU-Style - Dependencies are tracked using Clang and GCC's -M flags, which write a
 * Makefile-syntax file which contains the dependencies of the file that is being compiled. This
 * file is generated at the same time that the primary output is generated, and does not occur in a
 * pre-compile dependency pass.
 * 2. MSVC-Style - Dependencies are tracked using the cl.exe /showIncludes flag, which writes the
 * path of every file that is read by the preprocsesor to the compiler's output. This also happens
 * at the same time as main compilation, and does not require a pre-scan pass. Unfortunately, MSVC
 * localizes this string, so we cannot properly track dependencies without knowing what language it
 * will emit beforehand. At the moment, we implement dependency tracking for English, but providing
 * other languages is not difficult.
