``bpt new``
###########

``bpt new`` can be used to generate a |bpt| project. At time of writing, the
generated project is very simple.

If no command-line arguments are provided, |bpt| will interactively ask for
values to be used to generate the project.

.. program:: bpt new

.. option:: <project-name>

    The new name of the project.

.. option:: --dir <project-directory>

    Specify the root directory of the new project. By default, will generate a
    subdirectory of the working directory with the given
    :option:`\<project-name\>`
