|bpt|
#####

**bpt** is the build and packaging tool design for simplicity, speed, and
embeddability.

|bpt| is a hybrid build system and package manager with a few distinguishing
design decisions that set it apart from current offerings. There's a lot to
learn, but I'm glad you're here! I hope you find |bpt| useful to you and your
projects.
